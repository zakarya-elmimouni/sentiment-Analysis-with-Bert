# Overview
This project implements a Sentiment Analysis model using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture. The model is fine-tuned on the IMDB Dataset, a widely used dataset for sentiment classification tasks, containing movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

The goal is to classify movie reviews into two categories: positive or negative sentiments.
