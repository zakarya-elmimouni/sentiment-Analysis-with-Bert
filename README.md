# Overview
This project implements a Sentiment Analysis model using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture. The model predicts whether a given sentence expresses a positive or negative sentiment. It is built and trained using TensorFlow/Keras and Hugging Face's pre-trained BERT model.
